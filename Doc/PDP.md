## Weekly Log

[Weekly Plan Overview →](../Files/WeeklyPlan.pdf)

### Week 1 | 24.02

**Plan:**  
- `LO1` Join a project group  
- `LO1` Brainstorm and for a project idea   
- `LO2` Discuss brainstormed project ideas and exchange reasoning 

**Reflection:**  
We found a project idea quite quickly, which helped set a clear direction early on. Since we are a group of two, there is no formal leadership structure, but we have a very close 1-on-1 dynamic that allows for direct, continuous communication and decision-making. This made collaboration efficient and transparent.

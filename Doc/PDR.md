# Personal Development Reflection (PDR)

**Name:** Joel Malagarriga Duarte  
**Track:** PRJ4 - Embedded Systems  
**Project:** Smart Radiator Thermostat  
**Start Date:** 24.02.2025

This Personal Development Reflection reviews my progress and learning throughout the project. It is based on the HBO-i framework learning goals, which you can revisit here: [Learning Goals →](./HBO-i.md). The project was managed in an agile way, and while the approach remained consistent, I found myself adapting and realigning priorities as challenges arose.

## LO 1: Plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way

### Realise  
During the project, I focused on independently handling moderately complex tasks, like coding the motor control and integrating sensors. At times, unexpected issues came up, especially with hardware connections and 3D printing delays, but I adapted by reassessing priorities and swapping tasks with my teammate to keep progress steady. The agile approach helped here, as it allowed us to iterate quickly and adjust plans based on what worked best.

### Design  
Designing the motor casing took more time than anticipated, which taught me about the importance of early and realistic planning. I gained valuable experience iterating on mechanical parts and understanding constraints from both hardware and software sides. I realized that flexibility in design, coupled with regular testing, is crucial to meet project goals on time.

## LO 2: Applies professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented organization, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted interaction

### Future-Oriented Organisation  
I aimed to think beyond immediate tasks by researching components and considering how the system could scale or adapt in the future. For example, choosing the DS18B20 sensor for its durability and accuracy was partly based on long-term usability. Still, some improvements in scheduling, like planning 3D print slots earlier, could have saved time and reduced stress.

### Investigative Ability  
Throughout the project, I investigated hardware and software problems actively, often troubleshooting with my teammate. This back-and-forth helped uncover solutions faster and deepened my understanding. When stuck, I didn’t hesitate to look for alternative approaches or seek new resources, which improved both the product and my problem-solving skills.

### Personal Leadership  
I worked on developing an entrepreneurial mindset by taking initiative in key parts of the project and being proactive in solving problems as they came up. This experience helped me grow personally, learning how to balance planning with flexibility. I also gained more insight into my own strengths and areas for improvement, which will help me in future projects and roles.

### Targeted Interaction  
Since our team was small, communication was straightforward and effective. I think working in a larger group would have been more challenging and pushed me further in developing my collaboration skills. Still, I made sure we stayed aligned and communicated clearly when explaining technical details or coordinating tasks.

### Overall Reflection and Improvements for Next Time

Looking back, I’m happy with how much I learned and contributed, especially given the early uncertainties. Agile methods helped me stay flexible, but some delays, like longer 3D printing times, taught me to plan resources and time more carefully. Swapping tasks with my teammate was a highlight, as it kept motivation high and shared knowledge grew.

For future projects, I want to improve my time management and prioritize early prototyping to catch issues sooner. Also, practicing leadership in larger teams will help me develop better communication strategies and manage more complex collaboration dynamics.

Overall, this project was a valuable step in my personal and professional growth, preparing me for more advanced challenges ahead.

# Sprint Review - PW1&2

During this sprint, the development process went well. The coding tasks were completed without significant issues, and the software components integrated well with the existing system.

On the hardware side, we encountered some challenges. Since soldering is relatively new to us, we struggled a bit with making reliable connections, which caused some delays and troubleshooting. However we managed to resolve these issues.

This sprint was valuable for improving both our technical skills and our collaboration. The hardware experience highlighted areas for improvement.

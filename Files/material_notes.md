# 3D Printing Materials Comparison

| Material | Pros | Cons | Typical Use | Source |
|----------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| **PLA** (Polylactic Acid) | - Easy to print<br>- Good detail<br>- Biodegradable | - Brittle<br>- Low heat resistance (~60°C) | General prototyping, visual models | [Hubs Guide](https://www.hubs.com/knowledge-base/pla-vs-abs-vs-petg/) |
| **ABS** (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) | - Stronger than PLA<br>- More heat-resistant (~105°C) | - Warps easily<br>- Fumes when printing | Functional parts, enclosures | [All3DP ABS Overview](https://all3dp.com/1/abs-3d-printer-filament-simplified/) |
| **PETG** (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) | - Tough<br>- Flexible<br>- Heat-resistant (~85°C) | - Slightly more difficult to print than PLA | Durable parts exposed to stress or heat | [MatterHackers PETG Guide](https://www.matterhackers.com/news/filament-comparison-guide-petg) |
| **ASA** (Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile) | - UV & weather resistant<br>- Heat-resistant | - Requires heated bed<br>- Slightly more difficult to print than ABS | Outdoor parts, casing near radiators | [Prusa ASA Guide](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/asa_177136) |
| **TPU** (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) | - Flexible<br>- Impact-resistant | - Harder to print<br>- Slow print speeds needed | Gaskets, flexible mounting | [Simplify3D TPU Guide](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/materials-guide/flexible/) |

## Recommendation for This Project

Since the smart thermostat will be near a heat source and requires durability but not extreme stress resistance, **PETG** is recommended for a balance of ease of printing, strength, and heat resistance.

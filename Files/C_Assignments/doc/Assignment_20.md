# <u> Assignment 20 threads </u>
1) Write a program that starts 1 (one) thread from main().
   The thread has to kill itself!
   Use printf’s in main() and in thread to show what happens.
2) Write a program that starts 5 threads. The threads kill themselves.
   The threads need to be killed in reversed order!
   Tip: function call sleep(1000) takes 1 sec.
   Use printf’s in main() and in the threads to show what happens. Include the threadID in the
   output.
3) Write a program that starts 1000 threads. Every thread takes 0.5 sec. and then kills itself.
   Use printf’s in main() and in the threads to show what happens. Include the threadID in the
   output.
   Assignments 21 Mailbox
1) Write a program that starts 2 threads (tasks). These tasks will communicate with each other.
   The producer task sends 20 integers to a ‘slow’ consumer task using a mailbox. The mailbox
   can contain only 10 messages (the size of the mailbox is 10 integers).
   Use printf’s in main() and in the threads to show what happens. <br>

Write a program that starts a producer task and a consumer task.

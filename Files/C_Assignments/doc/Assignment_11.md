# <u> Assignment 11 </u>
First study chapter 13.1 of the text book: http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/tbailey/ctext
And find out how to read strings from the command prompt. <br>

Use the enum week as defined in the slides, use a global defined array of Week items with some fix
size N where N is defined as a symbolic constant. <br>

Write 2 functions, the first which reads a number of strings and convert them to the corresponding
enum value and sequential stores this in your global defined array, the second functions sequential
gets the gobal array items and prints the corresponding strings. <br>

And of course, as smart as possible based on the topics we discussed until now. <br>

Write a main() to test your functions, use different test scenarios.

# <u> Assignment 6 </u>
Write a function which is declared as follows:
```C
unsigned char pbcd(int n);
```
pbcd returns the two least significant digits as a “packed binary coded decimals” byte.
E.g. n=12345 than 4 and 5 are two least significant digits, the “packed binary coded decimals” byte is
0100 0101 (0100 is 4, 0101 is 5)<br>
Write a main() to test your function, use different test scenarios, find a smart way to test.

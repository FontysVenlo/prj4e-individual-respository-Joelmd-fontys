# Sprint Review - PW3&4&5

During these final project weeks, development progressed smoothly and many core components were successfully completed. The coding for LoRa communication, temperature sensing, and motor control integrated well and showed solid functionality.

On the hardware side, 3D printing the motor casing went well, building on prior experience. However, designing the casing took longer than expected, which impacted the timeline and meant the remote control casing was not completed. Print times at the university also caused some delays, suggesting that better scheduling or checking printer availability would improve future workflows.

Overall, this sprint reinforced our collaboration and problem-solving. We frequently swapped tasks when stuck, allowing fresh perspectives and mutual learning. Communication remained consistent with set meeting days, which helped maintain steady progress.

This sprint was an important phase for consolidating both our technical skills and teamwork in preparation for final integration and testing.
